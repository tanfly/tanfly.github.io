Besides messing with the html of my myspace back in high school, I had never coded a single thing in my life prior to starting my coding bootcamp journey. 

I learned that I enjoyed the challenge once I began the free prework provided by Flatiron, but I have to admit I was intimidated by the challenge of a full time coding bootcamp. I was really nervous waiting for my start date. 

I'm now three weeks in, and I just reached my first project, creating my own CLI Data Gem. I've learned so much already and I'm excited to put all the things I've learned to the test with this project. I like the fact that this will be entirely my own brainchild, created from scratch.

As I've gone through the lessons, I've often found myself surprised by what coding enables you to do. You can create programs that do anything, really. The possibilities are limitless. So many times I've said out loud, "You can *do* that?! That's so cool!" 

For example, modules. A module is sort of like a descriptive file, where you can define any number of methods. The cool thing about them is that you can then include the module (for instance methods) or extend the module (for class methods) *inside* classes, and then those methods are available to you there. This is handy if you have completely unrelated classes where it wouldn't make sense for one to inherit from the other. 

The example given in the lesson was that of a professional dancer and a kid who goes to see the dance. The dancer knows the moves, obviously, and the kid, from seeing the show, has learned some moves. The professional dancer and the kid have nothing in common, except for knowing those moves. So you can make a module of just those moves, and both the dancer class and the kid class can access them. 

That is so cool! It's such an abstract concept. There are so many tiny points of commonality like that in the real world, and it just amazes me that you can translate that into code. It's just a little like playing god, being able to simulate such abstract real world concepts with code, and it amazes me. 

I can't wait to try it out with my own code. I have an idea for my CLI Project and it will be a fun challenge to see it through from the ground up.
